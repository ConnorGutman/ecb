            The field of Environmental Science, an Interdisciplinary branch of the natural sciences, describes a broad range of methodical focuses aimed at furthering humanity‚Äôs understanding of the natural world. Particularly, the field focuses on analyzing the various connections between the Earth‚Äôs various ecological systems. Some general disciplines considered to be a part of the Environmental Science umbrella include atmospheric sciences, ecology, geosciences, and environmental chemistry. However, within each of these disciplines, Environmental Scientists often find a specialization within a particular area or issue which interests them. This could include a focus in agricultural systems, renewable energies, environmental policy and law, earth systems, issues relating to climate change, and beyond.<br><br>From a societal perspective, the field of Environmental Science holds a critical responsibility to the success and wellbeing of humanity. Many Environmental Scientists work as researchers or consultants for government agencies such as the EPA, NOAA, and the Forest Service (Oregon State, 2019). Others might take on roles as engineers or scientists at Environmental consulting firms, non-profits, and startups aiming to solve some of the planet‚Äôs biggest issues. In addition, many individuals studying Environmental Science further their education by attending law school, becoming Environmental lawyers or regulatory policy drafters. Altogether, these careers universally provide an array of public health services and oversight which protect individuals as well as the planet. Further, Environmental Scientists seek answers to some of humanity‚Äôs most prominent and challenging battles such as climate change. With a focus in Agriculture, for example, an Environmental Scientist might address issues regarding global food security in an ever-changing climate. Such a scientist may study a changing climate‚Äôs effects on insect populations such as the European Corn Borer, and how rising levels of pests affect global food security. Broadly, the field of Environmental Science has much to offer for the planet and for global communities.

        <h2>
          <mark>
            Throughout the 21st-century climate change and rising global temperatures will present new challenges and unintended consequences for humanity‚Äôs various agricultural systems. With regards to global food security, an increase in mean surface temperatures of 1-2 degrees Celsius will likely have a devastating result on annual crop-loss rates. Researchers at Standford University‚Äôs School of Earth, Energy, and Environmental Sciences project that for each degree Celsius that the planet warms, crop-loss figures will increase by a factor of 10-25% (Urton, 2018). A leading cause of this increase comes as a result of climate change‚Äôs diverse effects on insect behaviors and populations. For many pests which threaten crops such as corn, wheat, and soy, an increase in mean surface temperatures could trigger both heightened metabolic responses and increased reproductive rates (ICIPE, 2019).<br><br>For the insect world as a whole though, rising surface temperatures will likely have a diverse range of effects. Some species which are well-adapted to specific climates and conditions may suffer significant losses due to more volatile temperatures and extreme weather events. In fact, it is difficult to tell for sure which species will benefit from climate change and which will suffer or perish entirely. Scientists at the University of East Anglia have conducted research which suggests that rising temperatures could damage the sperm of many common insects, and therefore might lead to unforeseen negative effects on the sexual behavior of all insects (Miley, 2018). While it is difficult to predict exactly what will unfold among specific insect populations, more evidence than not suggests that for the European Corn Borer (Crambidae Species: Ostrinia nubilalis) climate change will result in few negative effects from the species populations as a result of their versatility and wide-ranging diet. A recent ten-year long study which was conducted in multiple North American regions found no reportable relationship between weather and the Ostrinia nubilalis‚Äô mortality rate (Capinera, 2019).<br><br>An invasive species first introduced to the United States in Boston, Massachuset circa 1917, the European Corn Borer will likely become a more prevalent threat for farmers across the world as the climate changes. The Ostrinia nubilalis is known to feed on a large variety of crops, not just corn, such as potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, corn, soy, and many common weeds (PSU, 2019). Within the field of Environmental Science, which encompasses the study of the planet's health and global issues such as climate change, such a large loss of crops has raised severe concerns among many. Rising populations could produce irreversible damage to our planet‚Äôs various ecosystems as well as to humanity‚Äôs global food security. Further, the Ostrinia nubilalis‚Äô versatile diet poses a unique threat to not only our own food supply but to natural crops and the many species which depend upon them in the wild as well. The result is a uniquely critical issue which will affect a wide range of components within our planet‚Äôs various ecosystems and networks.

        <p class="subtext" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 0;">The European Corn Borer (Family: Crambidae Species: Ostrinia nubilalis) is an invasive species which was first introduced to the United States in Boston, Massachuset circa 1917. Prior to the larval stage, the eggs of the Ostrinia nubilalis are deposited on the underside of various leaves and crops. Eggs are generally deposited in clusters of 15-20, their appearance has a semi-translucent white color with a flattened oval shape (Capinera, 2000). After being deposited, the European Corn Borer‚Äôs eggs will hatch in four to nine days.<br><br>Upon the larval stage, the Ostrinia nubilalis gains a pinkish complexion with scattered dark spots, as well as smooth and hairless skin (PSU, 2019). It is in this stage of development that the Ostrinia nubilalis is known to feed on a large range of popular crops such as corn, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, sorghum, soy, as well as several common weeds (PSU, 2019). The European Corn Borer will embed itself in these crops, feeding and developing through the pupal stage into adulthood. Adult Ostrinia nubilalis typically develops in late spring, becoming winged moths with a dark brown color. Male borers reach 20-26 mm in wingspan, while females reach 25-34 mm (Capinera, 2000). Wings are covered in a darkened zig-zag pattern, as well as light splotches. During adulthood, the species is most active during night hours and live anywhere from 18 to 24 days.<br><br>An interesting evolutionary advantage of the European Corn Borer is its ability to adapt to a vast range of climates and conditions. While the species does better in warmer and more humid conditions, a recent ten-year long study which was conducted in multiple North American regions found no reportable relationship between weather and the Ostrinia nubilalis‚Äô mortality rate (Capinera, 2019). Because of this the species can survive in varying conditions and is found in most states east of the rocky mountains (PSU, 2019). Given the species‚Äô wide-ranging diet, as well as its robustness and adaptability to most climates, the Ostrinia nubilalis presents a unique challenge for future food security. As climate change worsens, the new temperature and humidity conditions among American agriculture could prove beneficial for the European Corn Borer. In addition, while other pests face higher mortality rates due to changing conditions, the Ostrinia nubilalis might find room to thrive.</p>

        <h2><mark>Given the Ostrinia nubilalis‚Äô natural ability to adapt to a vast range of climates and conditions, increasing global temperatures brought about by climate change will likely produce new growth for the species as a whole. While other insects suffer significant losses as a result of increased global temperatures and more frequent extreme weather occurrences, the European corn borer will gain access to new suitable lands and reproductive room in place of other‚Äôs losses. Known to feed on a large variety of crops such as corn, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, corn, soy, and many common weeds the Ostrinia nubilalis is likely to flourish anywhere without much natural competition (PSU, 2019). With this in mind, the Ostrinia nubilalis could be a serious threat to global food security. A threat which comes at a time of heightened pressure on critical crops such as corn and soy due to increasingly inhospitable agricultural conditions.<br><br>Researchers at Standford University‚Äôs School of Earth, Energy, and Environmental Sciences project that for each degree Celsius that the planet warms, crop-loss figures will increase by a factor of 10-25% (Urton, 2018). This projection is due to factors such as more frequent heat waves, decreased annual rainfall, and volatile changes to global insect populations. Ultimately this figure shows the necessity for developing new technologies and approaches to humanity‚Äôs agricultural systems over the 21st century and beyond. Should humanity hope to meet increasing crop demands while facing decreasing crop production, alternative methods of crop cultivation such as hydroponics and vertical farming will be critical to avoiding catastrophe. Such a challenge will likely highlight the negative qualities associated with insects, and as such might, unfortunately, worsen insect-human relationships. It is likely that insects will be seen as a threat to survival during this period, not as a key element of the ecosystem which ensures food and survival for all. As such, it will be more important than ever to defend and highlight the role of insects within the Earth‚Äôs various systems and components.<br><br>However, the role which the Ostrinia nubilalis will play over the coming decades might not be all negative. Within affected urban and rural communities alike, there could be a positive element to rising European corn borer populations. The challenges brought about by this pest will require the convergence of technology with new fields such as agriculture and entomology. Such demand could lead to new industries and jobs seeking to develop solutions to humanity‚Äôs most difficult crop-related problems. Should a sizable sum of conventional agriculture across the midwestern United States and other regions of the world no longer be viable as a result of climate change, no aspect of society will be unaffected. The agricultural industry is a backbone of humanity, and such a massive reversal in food security as projected by Stanford will demand cooperation from everyone. Should this critical issue be taken seriously and treated proactively, it might give entomologists a valuable voice on the global stage in shaping the future of how humanity interacts with the environment and insects. </mark></h2>
